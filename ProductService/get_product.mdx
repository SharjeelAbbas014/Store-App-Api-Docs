# Get a product
The store and users get product from its catalogue. Store must be login to make request to get product from the catalogue. While users can access product using there apps.

## Disclamer
I am not adding option to retieve all products offered by store because dynamodb has query limit of 100 items. Moreover I don't see any use case where store want to access its millions of product at once. 

#### Send POST Request 
<Code>
/api/product/
</Code>

#### With following JSON data
```json
{
"id": "String",
"storeId": "String",
}
```

##### Expected Response
```json
{
    "name": "String",
    "id": "String",
    "storeid": "String",
    "price": "float",
    "discount": "float",
    "brand": "String",
    "categories": String[],
    "tags": String[],
    "location": "String",
    "inStock": "int",
    "ExpiryDate": "2021-10-03 12:13",
    "totalSold": "int",
    "lastStockAddition": "2021-10-03 12:13",
    "description": "string"
}
```
